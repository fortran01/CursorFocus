# CursorFocus

A lightweight tool that maintains a focused view of your project structure and environment. CursorFocus automatically tracks your project files, functions, and environment variables, updating every 60 seconds to keep you informed of changes.

## Features

- 🔄 Real-time project structure tracking
- 📝 Automatic file and function documentation
- 🌳 Hierarchical directory visualization
- 📏 File length standards and alerts
- 🎯 Project-specific information detection
- 🔍 Smart project type detection (Chrome Extension, Node.js, Python)
- 🧩 Modular and extensible design
- 🎛️ Automatic .cursorrules generation and project adaptation

## Multi-Project Support

CursorFocus can monitor multiple projects simultaneously. There are two ways to set this up:

### 1. Automatic Project Detection

Run CursorFocus with the scan option to automatically detect projects:
```bash
python CursorFocus/setup.py --scan /path/to/projects/directory
```

This will:
- Scan the directory for supported project types
- List all detected projects
- Let you choose which projects to monitor

### 2. Manual Configuration

Edit `config.json` to add multiple projects:
```json
{
    "projects": [
        {
            "name": "Project 1",
            "project_path": "/path/to/project1",
            "type": "node_js",
            "watch": true
        },
        {
            "name": "Project 2",
            "project_path": "/path/to/project2",
            "type": "chrome_extension",
            "watch": true
        }
    ]
}
```

Each project can have its own:
- Custom update interval
- Ignored patterns
- File length standards
- Project-specific rules

### Project Types Supported:
- Chrome Extensions (detected by manifest.json)
- Node.js Projects (detected by package.json)
- Python Projects (detected by setup.py or pyproject.toml)
- React Applications (detected by src/App.js)
- Generic Projects (basic structure)

## Alternative Setup Methods

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

1. Install dependencies (Python 3.6+ required):
   ```bash
   cd CursorFocus
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create/edit config.json (optional)
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 focus.py
   ```

## Generated Files

CursorFocus automatically generates and maintains three key files:

1. **Focus.md**: Project documentation and analysis
   - Project overview and structure
   - File descriptions and metrics
   - Function documentation
   
2. **.cursorrules**: Project-specific Cursor settings
   - Automatically generated based on project type
   - Customized for your project's structure
   - Updates as your project evolves
   


## Setup

1. Clone or copy the CursorFocus directory to your project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RenjiYuusei/CursorFocus.git CursorFocus
   ```

2. Install dependencies (Python 3.6+ required):
   ```bash
   cd CursorFocus
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python focus.py
   ```

## Setup

1. Clone repository it
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run setup to configure the projects you want to monitor:
```bash
python setup.py --scan
```

## Usage

1. Run the program:
```bash
python focus.py
```

2. To run automatically when the computer starts:
- Windows: Create a shortcut to `focus.py` and set it to run at startup
- Linux: Add the command to run to `.bashrc` or create a systemd service

## Output

CursorFocus generates a `Focus.md` file in your project root with:

1. Project Overview
   - Project name and description
   - Key features and version
   - Project type detection

2. Project Structure
   - Directory hierarchy
   - File descriptions
   - Function listings with detailed descriptions
   - File type detection
   - File length alerts based on language standards

3. Code Analysis
   - Key function identification
   - Detailed function descriptions
   - File length standards compliance

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize:

```json
{
    "project_path": "",
    "update_interval": 60,
    "max_depth": 3,
    "ignored_directories": [
        "__pycache__",
        "node_modules",
        "venv",
        ".git",
        ".idea",
        ".vscode",
        "dist",
        "build",
        "coverage"
    ],
    "ignored_files": [
        ".DS_Store",
        "Thumbs.db",
        "*.pyc",
        "*.pyo",
        "package-lock.json",
        "yarn.lock"
    ]
}
```

## File Length Standards

CursorFocus includes built-in file length standards for different file types:

- JavaScript/TypeScript:
  - Regular files: 300 lines
  - React components (.jsx/.tsx): 250 lines

- Python files: 400 lines

- Style files:
  - CSS/SCSS/LESS/SASS: 400 lines

- Template files:
  - HTML: 300 lines
  - Vue/Svelte components: 250 lines

- Configuration files:
  - JSON/YAML/TOML: 100 lines

- Documentation files:
  - Markdown/RST: 500 lines

The tool will alert you when files exceed these recommended limits.
